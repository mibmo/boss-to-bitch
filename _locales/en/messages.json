    "message": "A person’s gender, age, race, or sexual orientation (or any personal characteristic) shouldn’t determine their access, opportunities, or quality of experience online. And yet . . . here we are. B0ss to Bitch agrees with that, but recognises that isn't reality and such believes that shielding people from the real world is a useless endevor. It aims to get particularly sensitive individuals acquainted with online behavior by replacing otherwise friendly or neutral words with derogatory ones.",
